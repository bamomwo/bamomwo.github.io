As a graduate student who has just entered the field of Artificial Intelligence, I am eager to contribute to the pursuit of superintelligence. It has been quite an intriguing journey so far. Initially, it involved a lot of learning, including taking Andrew Ng courses, watching Stanford Machine Learning courses on YouTube, reading blog posts, and following the most popular AI researchers on X (where I get updates on what's happening in the AI world). With a strong background in mathematics and coding, it was easy to start actively learning about AI, although I sometimes had to revisit MIT math courses on YouTube for refreshers. After a while (about a year), I became quite conversant with concepts like backpropagation, loss functions, optimisation, normalisation, etc. I literally would walk through backpropagation with a pen and paper, just to make sure I understood these concepts. 

With a solid understanding, I decided to take another step, [Andrej Karpathy Zero to Hero Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ). Listening to that guy’s tutorial while practicing is a gold mine. You actually get to implement neural networks while reviewing the mathematics on a piece of paper (the best part was explaining backpropagation using the computation graph). At this point, I felt very familiar with the field, especially when reading X posts from startups or AI labs releasing new content. (It was also easy to look up new concepts I didn’t know when I saw them in X posts.) 

I felt happy at this point, but that was just the beginning. The next adventure was to dive into the world of reading papers. I was still in my first year of the master’s program at that time, which was very coursework-intensive (in China, the first year is very demanding with requirements to meet minimum credits). On weekends, I am always occupied with assignments and preparing presentations (a common practice in China, where presenting on course topics is almost a requirement in all courses). However, I still take the time to read some papers. The papers I read were largely influenced by ML courses I have taken or research on X, and I posted their works. Initially, I found reading papers very difficult due to their technical nature; however, I discovered that using an LLM, with ChatGPT being my favourite, helped me read them more effectively. Now I can read papers I find interesting incredibly fast without the use of any LLM. This boils down to the knowledge you have accumulated through previous reading! 

Through this brief journey of breaking into AI, I can say that research is indeed for the determined. You can think of a good researcher as a person who literally just thinks critically about a single problem he is working on for months, every day, every hour, every second. You think, you experiment, you write, and you iterate. That’s the process! This is obviously boring for the average individual; however, it is from this process that breakthroughs are born, and the people who actually do it love it.
