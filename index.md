I am a research student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research interest broadly lies in the intersection of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I am passionate about designing algorithms to push the frontier in AI. Currently, I am pursuing a master's in software engineering, where I work on exploring machine learning solutions to learn health baselines of individuals from wearable data for personalized health monitoring. Before my master's, I earned a bachelor's in computer science from the University of Development Studies in Ghana. 

Beyond my current focus on applied AI/ML in healthcare, I also deeply research the "holy grail" of AI, which is creating self-improving intelligent systems. In this area, I am curious about the role of Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language processing in self-improving intelligent systems. Some of the important questions I investigate are "Can next token prediction truly create intelligent systems?", "How far do LLMs generalize, and is that enough to create self-improving intelligent systems?

Aside from research, I like to read history and politics. Feel free to reach out to me for research or casual discussions.
