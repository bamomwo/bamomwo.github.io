I am a Master's student in Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I am currently interested in developing AI-based educational systems and wearable health monitoring technologies. Below are a few questions I am interested in:

**Machine Learning & Health:**
- How can we develop personalized health baselines from wearable biosignals for early disease detection?
- Can deep learning frameworks effectively model individual physiological patterns for anomaly detection?
- How do we handle the challenge of unsupervised learning in health monitoring applications?

**Educational Technology:**
- How can large language models be leveraged to create truly personalized learning experiences?
- What role does prompt engineering play in adaptive tutoring systems?
- Can we build intelligent systems that adapt to individual learning patterns and preferences?

**Research Applications:**
- How can computer vision techniques improve healthcare monitoring through wearable devices?
- What are the best approaches for signal processing in physiological data analysis?
- How can we bridge the gap between AI research and practical educational applications?

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University for Development Studies, Ghana, where I graduated with First Class Honors. During my undergraduate studies, I served as President of the Computer Science Association and was awarded the MTN Bright Scholarship.

I have professional experience as a Technology Officer at Afro Technologies, where I contributed to backend infrastructure design for educational technology products and led prototyping of adaptive learning tools.
