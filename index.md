I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. Zhen Qin. Prior to this, I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University for Development Studies, Ghana.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and large language models, particularly their applications in software systems. At present, my work focuses on using machine learning specifically anomaly detection to model individual health baselines from wearable sensor data, enabling early detection of potential diseases. This aligns with the broader research direction of my lab.

Beyond my current focus, I am deeply passionate about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the pursuit of superintelligence. In the coming years, I aspire to conduct extensive research in this area, potentially through a PhD program.

I enjoy sharing my thoughts on topics I’m currently researching, as well as broader trends and discussions in AI. Feel free to explore my blog where you'll notice that I often take a reflective and independent approach, rather than simply following popular opinion.

Feel free to reachout to me for research or casual discussions.
